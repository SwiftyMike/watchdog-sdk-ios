This library supports an asynchronous background search for journey plans through Mileus, with the base use case of commuting home from the user's current location.

Please see the [Watchdog search docs](https://docs.mileus.com/watchdog-search/) for more details about the functionality, or the [SDK docs](https://docs.mileus.com/watchdog-search/frontend-integration/sdk/ios/) for more details about the usage of this SDK.

## Requirements

* iOS 11.0+
* Xcode 11.0+
* Swift 5.0+

## Installation

### Carthage

```
github "mileus/watchdog-sdk-ios" ~> 0.1.0
```

### Cocoapods

```
pod 'MileusWatchdogKit', '~> 0.1'
```

### Swift Package Manager
We are waiting for Swift 5.3 official release. It does not work yet.

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/mileus/watchdog-sdk-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
]
```

## Configuration
First you need to configure Mileus SDK in your `AppDelegate.application(:, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`
``` swift
MileusWatchdogKit.configure(
    partnerName: String, // Unique partner identifier
    accessToken: String, // Token from Watchdog Auth API
    environment: MileusWatchdogEnvironment // Environment type (staging or production)
) // throws exception (MileusWatchdogError.invalidInput) if partnerName or accessToken is an empty string
```

## Usage

### Start Mileus SDK screen
This is a universal entry point in Mileus SDK. Use it to initialise new search, as well as opening Mileus SDK from notification.

You have to keep a reference to mileusSearch instance as long as you need it.
``` swift
let mileusWatchdogSearch = MileusSearch(
    delegate: MileusWatchdogSearchFlowDelegate,
    origin: MileusWatchdogLocation? = nil, 
    destination: MileusWatchdogLocation? = nil 
) // throws exception (MileusWatchdogError.instanceAlreadyExists) if you have already created an instance or exception (MileusWatchdogError.sdkIsNotInitialized) if you have not initialized sdk yet.
```

Show Mileus screen:
``` swift
let mileusVC = mileusWatchdogSearch.show(from: UIViewController)
```

### Search Flow Delegate
Methods of Flow Delegate are always called on the main thread.
``` swift
protocol MileusWatchdogSearchFlowDelegate {
    func mileus(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch, showSearch data: MileusWatchdogSearchData)
    func mileusShowTaxiRide(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
    func mileusShowTaxiRideAndFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
    func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
}
```

### Search for origin or destination
``` swift
func mileus(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch, showSearch data: MileusWatchdogSearchData)
```

When it is called you should open your search view controller.

Update origin or destination according to userâ€™s choice:

``` swift
mileusWatchdogSearch.updateOrigin(location: MileusWatchdogLocation)
mileusWatchdogSearch.updateDestination(location: MileusWatchdogLocation)
```

### Open taxi ride Activity
``` swift
func mileusShowTaxiRide(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
```

When it is called you should open your taxi ride view controller.

### Open taxi ride and finish
``` swift
func mileusShowTaxiRideAndFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
```

When it is called you should close `mileusVC` and open your taxi ride view controller.
You get `mileusVC` after calling `mileusWatchdogSearch.show(from:)`.

### Finish
``` swift
func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
```

You are responsible for closing `mileusVC`. You get `mileusVC` after calling `mileusWatchdogSearch.show(from:)`.

## Models

### Classes

*Mileus Search* - Throws exception if `accessToken` is an empty string.
``` swift
class MileusWatchdogSearch {

    destination: MileusWatchdogLocation? = nil
    )
    
    func show(from: UIViewController) -> UIViewController
    func updateOrigin(location: MileusWatchdogLocation)
    func updateDestination(location: MileusWatchdogLocation)
}
```

### Delegates
*Search Flow Delegate* - Methods of Flow Delegate are always called on the main thread.

    func mileusShowTaxiRide(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
    func mileusShowTaxiRideAndFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
    func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
}
```

### Data
